# Expense Tracking App (Level 1)
This application was designed to help users with their personal finance methods. The application also helps users to keep track of their budgets. By manually recording their income and expenses in the app, users can see how much money they've spent and how much they've saved whenever they want. The app can also help users identify where their spending is going and where they can save money.


The purpose of this application is to learn how to use SQLite database and create graphs. In this application users' data is kept locally. And thanks to the chart on the homepage, they observe how much they spend and how much they earn.

You can see the more advanced version of this application by [clicking here](https://github.com/BerkErdgn/ExpenseTrackingApp-Level2-).
